# Curve: JavaScript front end


This is the repo containing the logic and styling which gives Curve its polishid look and feel.  We are using cutting-edge JavaScript frameworks such as Gatsby, Apollo, and SASS.  Our queries are lightning fast thanks to GraphQL.  With inspiration from the Medium site -Snowflake- we used their amazing circle graph, thermometer, and Proficiency bar.  Our two teams worked tirelessly and relentlessly to bring this site to life and should be commended on their persistence and dedication to the integrity of this applicaiton.

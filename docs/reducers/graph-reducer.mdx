# Graph Reducer
## ```./src/reducers/graph-reducer.js```
The graph reducer implements app functionality based on the action definitions in the graph-actions.js file.


## setIndividualsData

### Description
Adds raw GraphQL data for a single user to state

```
    case 'setIndividualsData':
      let graphQLRawData = payload
      return { ...state, graphQLRawData }
```

## setFocusedTrackId

### Description
Updates state with the user selected track which is displayed in detail below the graph, i.e. "Mission and Vision" or "Adaptibility"

```
    case 'setFocusedTrackId':
      let index = trackIds.indexOf(payload)
      const focusedTrackId = trackIds[index]
      return { ...state, focusedTrackId }
```

## handleTrackMilestoneChange

### Description
Updates changes in a given milestone and eligible titles, i.e. total points, sub categories, selected title.

```
    case 'handleTrackMilestoneChange':
      let [trackId, milestone] = payload
      const milestoneByTrack = state.milestoneByTrack
      milestoneByTrack[trackId] = milestone

      const titles = eligibleTitles(milestoneByTrack)
      const title = titles.indexOf(state.title) === -1 ? titles[0] : state.title

      // Update total points
      const totalPoints = totalPointsFromMilestoneMap(state.milestoneByTrack)

      // Update category points
      const categoryPoints = categoryPointsFromMilestoneMap(
        state.milestoneByTrack
      )

      return {
        ...state,
        focusedTrackId: trackId,
        title,
        totalPoints,
        categoryPoints,
      }
```

## setTitle

### Description
Sets state with a new title in the eligible job titles.

```
   case 'setTitle':
      let newTitle = payload
      let availableTitles = eligibleTitles(state.milestoneByTrack)
      newTitle =
        availableTitles.indexOf(newTitle) == -1 ? availableTitles[0] : newTitle

      return { ...state, title: newTitle }
```

## NameInputChange

### Description
Sets state with a new user name.

```
    case 'NameInputChange':
      return { ...state, name: payload }
```

## shiftFocusedTrack

### Description

```
  case 'shiftFocusedTrack':
      let delta = payload
      let idx = trackIds.indexOf(state.focusedTrackId)
      idx = (idx + delta + trackIds.length) % trackIds.length
      let newFocusedTrackId = trackIds[idx]
      return { ...state, focusedTrackId: newFocusedTrackId }
```

## shiftFocusedTrackMilestone

### Description

```
    case 'shiftFocusedTrackMilestone':
      let change = payload
      let prevMilestone = state.milestoneByTrack[state.focusedTrackId]
      let newMilestoneValue = prevMilestone + change
      if (newMilestoneValue < 0) newMilestoneValue = 0
      if (newMilestoneValue > 5) newMilestoneValue = 5
      // Somehow Dispatch 'handleTrackMilestoneChange' somehow with parameters (state.focusedTrackId, newMilestone)

      // TODO: fix this anti-pattern. We're calling an action within a reducer. There are better ways to do this, like with an event listener or some middleware to allow "asyncDispatch". Google "calling an action within a reducer, redux"
      return {}
